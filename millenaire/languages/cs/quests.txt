sadhu_5_adivasi_0_description=$name, we need to continue gathering data on this world. I believe the marshes to be particularly important places – they seem to be present far more than natural forces would suggest. Thankfully for you, there will be no need to explore them yourself. There are people whose knowledge of them is unmatched: the adivasi farmers. Those men are poor and looked down upon by the villagers, but they are observant and spend their lives deep in the marshes. Find one and ask him for information. Tell him you are coming on my behalf and he will be welcoming.
sadhu_5_adivasi_0_description_success=I cannot give you directions to their dwellings, but search the marshes and you should find them.

sadhu_9_topandbottom_0_label=Limity sveta
sadhu_9_topandbottom_0_description=$name, there is a last challenge I need you to undertake for me. I know from reports of courageous Indian explorers that this new world is vast - in the first few years after the night of fire which took us here, many young Indian villagers travelled far and wide to find known shores again, in vain. They also never saw any mountain that is worthy of that name, something to rival the mighty Himalayas. I have thought hard about it, and this has come to my mind: the sky here looks as high as it ever was over the plains of the Ganges, but the clouds are always low, and never do we see any birds or creature above them. Could it be that everything above them is an illusion? You need to go and see for yourself what is there above the clouds.
sadhu_9_topandbottom_0_description_success=You may start by climbing the branches of this venerable tree if it helps your undertaking.

Is this world a mockery of the real one then, the work of a demon or a god? $name, you must confirm this finding. You must see if this world is finite downward as well, if this ground we live in is but a thin slice of earth floating on nothingness.

sadhu_9_topandbottom_2_description_success=So you met rocks too hard to break and could go downward no further. And you say this was the height of thirty men below the surface. There is too much symmetry at work here, $name. It cannot be, and yet it is.<ret><ret>I have no more work for you now. I need to think and meditate and pray for guidance, until I can make sense of all of this. Come back in some time and I will give you the results of my finding, if Lord Ganesh inspires me.

Very well, I will go through it then.<ret><ret>I have big experiences in mind for now however, $name. As you might have observed in your travels this world has no volcanos like those of our old Europe, but the soil is full of lava and it is not uncommon to see streams of it at the surface.
